# Well-being as Prediction'

This repository provides the supporting code for the models described in "Well-being as Prediction".

Anyone can request access to the individual datasets by submitting the form found at: http://statements.centerdata.nl/liss-panel-data-statement.
These datasets can be downloaded in either SPSS or SAS form. 
We used the latter and did the preprocessing using a free version of SAS which can be found here: https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html.

We cannot explicitly provide the merged LISS dataset since it does not belong to us, but we have provided the scripts we used for preprocessing and merging in the data folder.
